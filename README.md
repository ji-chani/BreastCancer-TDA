# BreastCancer-TDA: Breast Cancer Mammogram Scans Classification using PHCA and HOG

**Authors:** CB Jetomo, MD De Lara

----
**Rationale:**
This paper harnesses the computational flexibility of Persistent Homology in classification of mammogram scans. These scans are used in medicine wherein breast tissues are exposed to small amounts of X-ray radiation to obtain an inside picture of the breast details for the purpose of abnormality/mass detection and classification [1]. Particularly, it aims to differentiate benign breast tumors from their malignant counterparts using the breast mammogram. Classification between benign and malignant images is done using Persistent Homology Classification Algorithm (PHCA) [2].
